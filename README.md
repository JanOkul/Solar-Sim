# Solar System Simulation

## Overview

This is a basic simulation of the solar system I made as part of a first-year course at university. It accurately simulates the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The simulation displays the time each planet takes to orbit the Sun in Earth years to the terminal. Additionally, there's an option to launch a satellite from Earth to Mars, which will eventually return back to Earth.

## Instructions

### Starting the Simulation

To start the simulation, simply run the `main.py` file.

### Adding a Satellite

To add a satellite, you need to pass in the `--satellite` argument to the `main.py` file.

### Viewing Final Energy

To see the final energy of the solar system, close the simulation window. A new window will appear displaying the energy.
